## Note on Project Requirements
These Projects are inspired by the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification challenges.
However, they have been adapted and customized beyond the original FCC requirements for creative and personal reasons.
‚ö†Ô∏è These versions may not pass the FCC automated test suite in their current form.
